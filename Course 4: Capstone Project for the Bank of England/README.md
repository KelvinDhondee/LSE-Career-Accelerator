This six-week capstone project for the LSE Data Analytics Career Accelerator gave our team of six students (Team BEACON), the opportunity to collaborate directly with the Bank of England. Our objective was to analyse the sentiment of BoE speeches and explore how that sentiment might be integrated into models predicting macroeconomic shifts.

As a team, we tested multiple sentiment analysis approaches—including transformer-based machine learning models and large language models (LLMs)—and applied a range of predictive modelling and time-series forecasting techniques (such as gradient boosting and SARIMAX). Our final recommendation to the Bank was to incorporate the CentralBankRoBERTa sentiment model, paired with appropriate time lags, to better capture the delayed impact of central bank communications.

My individual contributions included:

- Compiling economic research primers to strengthen our team’s understanding of relevant macroeconomic concepts and context
- Developing and implementing an advanced time-series forecasting model (SARIMAX) that demonstrated how sentiment data could improve economic predictions
- 
I was fortunate to work alongside five exceptional analysts, each of whom brought unique expertise and creativity to the project. The folder with the .ipynb files contains everyone’s contributions, with initials indicating the analyst responsible for each notebook.

Highlights of my teammates' work include:

- Chris Buck (CB): Team lead, driving all aspects of the project; instrumental in collecting, cleaning, and merging economic indicator data
- Germán de la Fuente (GF): Web scraped the most recent BoE speeches, and ran predictive models including scenario analysis using external volatility indicators
- Harshdeep Kohli (HK): Applied multiple sentiment models and implemented a gradient boosting regression that clearly demonstrated the predictive value of speech sentiment
- Kate Jacobs (KJ): Led comparison of sentiment models using a rigorous testing framework, analysed sentiment trends over time, and conducted LDA topic modelling of the speech data
- Victoria Pogonyaylova (VP): Took a lead role in data cleaning and exploratory analysis, and customised the CentralBankRoBERTa sentiment model to meet our specialised requirements
